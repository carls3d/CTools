The .py files are not an add-on, but the scripts used in the add-on. 
All UI elements and interactions are made with [Serpens](https://blendermarket.com/products/serpens), which makes the final code hard to read.

This github repository is for sharing the scripts used in the free add-on and allowing others to contribute if they wish.
