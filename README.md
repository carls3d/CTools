The .py files are not an add-on, but the scripts used in the add-on. 
All UI elements and interactions are made with [Serpens](https://blendermarket.com/products/serpens), which makes the final code hard to read.

If you don't want to read the code or contribute, click the "Ko-Fi Link" to download the add-on!
